# Java Benchmark - BCCA Nomination

For this benchmark you are building software to automate processing BCCA student nominations. For a high school student to become a BCCA student, they must first be nominated by using the form pictured below.

![BCCA nomination form](bcca-nomination-form.png)

This form allows BCCA to collect and process nominations for students. Your job is to turn this form into a terminal application. Instead of filling out this web form, BCCA wants to put a computer in high school teacher's lounges with a program that allows teachers to fill out a nomination. Reference the form pictured above to determine what data is necessary from the user.

## Requirements

A teacher should be able to nominate a student in a similar format to the form pictured above.

Your code should be readable.

Your applications should be usable.

## Levels of Success

- **Needs Improvement**
  - Teachers can nominate a student, but the data isn't stored between program executions.
- **Meets Expectations**
  - Teachers can nominate a student, and the data is stored between program executions.
- **Exceeds Expectations**
  - A separate application is developed for BCCA employees:
    - BCCA employees can view placed nominations.
    - BCCA employees can mark a nomination as approved or denied.

## Submission

Email Sean, Nate, and Fernae a link to the Github repository containing your solution.
